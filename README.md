 List of Dependency I have to add for this tutorial.
 ```
“web”, “mysql”, “jpa”, “security”, “Actuator” , “DevTool” and “Lombok” as Dependency.
Web --> Starter for building web application, including RESTful, Spring MVC. And Tomcat as the default embedded container.
mysql --> JDBC Type driver for MySQL
jpa --> Starter for using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
security --> Starter for using Spring Security
Actuator --> Starter for using Spring Boot's Actuator which provides production ready features to help you monitor and manage your application
DevTool --> additional set of tools that can make the application development experience a little more pleasant
Lombok --> Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code for model/data objects, e.g., it can generate getters and setters for those object automatically by using Lombok annotations. The easiest way is to use the @Data annotation.
